# Eyecare-assistant
This OpenCV-based C++ project helps reduce digital eye strain by monitoring screen time through face detection. When the user is detected continuously for a set period, it sends a reminder to follow the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.
